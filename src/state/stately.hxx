 * save() should be overriden if the object needs to save its state
 * reset() should be overriden if the object can clear its state
 *
 * The flexibility allows eg LooperClips to request buffers to tranfser audio
 * data into the GUI thread for disk serialization, and scales for future
 * classes which also need to request memory in order to save in a RT safe way.
